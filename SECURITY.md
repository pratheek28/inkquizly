With details. Include the following, if possible:

We will respond as soon as possible to confirm receipt of your report. After triage, we aim to provide updates at least **once a week** while we work on a resolution.

## Disclosure Process

1. You report the vulnerability to us privately.
2. We acknowledge receipt and begin the investigation.

4. Once a fix is ready, we may:
   - Release a patch publicly, crediting you (if desired).
   - Coordinate disclosure timing with you if it's a severe issue.

If a report is found to be invalid or not applicable, we will let you know with reasoning.

Please **do not** create public issues or pull requests regarding security concerns.
